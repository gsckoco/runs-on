# RunsOn: 10x cheaper GitHub Action runners.

**Remove 90% of your CI spend**. **Faster** builds. In your AWS account.

RunsOn is the **modern way to run self-hosted GitHub Actions runners** of any size, at the cheapest price available.

## Core features

- ✅ **Faster**. Raw [CPU performance is up 30%](https://runs-on.com/benchmarks/github-actions-runners/) compared to official runners.
- ✅ **Cheaper**. Between [7x to 15x cheaper](https://runs-on.com/calculator/) than official runners.
- ✅ **Scalable**. Handles bursts of multiple hundred jobs at once without issue. No concurrency limit.
- ✅ **Full workflow compatibility** with official GitHub runners. Use the [compatible public AMIs for AWS](https://github.com/runs-on/runner-images-for-aws), or [bring your own images](https://runs-on.com/features/byoi/).
- ✅ **Low maintenance**. A single [CloudFormation template](./cloudformation/template.yaml) with all the resources, 1-click install, 1-click upgrades. Costs $1.5/month.

## Secondary features

- **Ephemeral VM** for each job.
- [Spot pricing](https://runs-on.com/features/spot-instances/), with **automatic fallback** to on-demand.
- Supports **native x64 and arm64** architectures.
- **Faster and unlimited caches**. An [integrated cache backend based on a local S3 bucket](https://runs-on.com/features/s3-cache-for-github-actions/) allows for up to 5x faster and unlimited cache for dependencies and docker layers.
- **SSH access** into the runners. Can be [restricted to a specific CIDR range](https://runs-on.com/features/ssh/).
- **Static IPs** for your runners, if you [enabled private networking](https://runs-on.com/features/static-ips/).
- Access **all EC2 Linux runner types available**, even **GPUs**, on AWS, with [dynamic instance selection and custom runner definitions](https://runs-on.com/features/custom-runners/).
